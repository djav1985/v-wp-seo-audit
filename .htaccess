# This .htaccess file is no longer needed as this is now a WordPress plugin.
# WordPress handles all routing through its own .htaccess file.
# This file is kept for reference only.

# Original standalone configuration (deprecated):
# RewriteEngine on
# if a directory or a file exists, use it directly
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# RedirectMatch 404 /\.git
# otherwise forward it to index.php
# RewriteRule . index.php
