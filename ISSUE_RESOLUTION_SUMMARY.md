# Issue Resolution Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to address the issues outlined in the problem statement.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ ABSPATH Security Checks

**Issue**: Ensure all files have `if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) { exit; }` when applicable.

**Resolution**: Added ABSPATH checks to all configuration files that were missing them:
- `config/config.php` - Added security check
- `config/domain_restriction.php` - Added security check
- `config/badwords.php` - Added security check
- `config/main.php` - Added security check

All other plugin files (includes/, templates/) already had this check in place.

### 2. ✅ Remove Yii Framework References

**Issue**: Comments referencing the old Yii framework should be removed as they are no longer relevant.

**Resolution**: Removed or updated Yii references in the following files:
- `includes/class-v-wpsa-db.php`
  - Changed "Provides WordPress-native database access methods to replace Yii's CActiveRecord and CDbCommand" to "Provides WordPress-native database access methods"
  - Changed "WordPress-native database wrapper to replace Yii database operations" to "WordPress-native database wrapper for plugin operations"
  - Changed "Use 'modified' timestamp to match Yii controller behavior" to "Use 'modified' timestamp for date calculations"

- `includes/class-v-wpsa-config.php`
  - Removed "Replaces Yii::app()->params[] calls" from class description
  - Removed "Replacement for Yii::app()->getBaseUrl(true)" from method comment

- `includes/class-v-wpsa-ajax-handlers.php`
  - Changed "WordPress-native implementation - no Yii dependencies" to "WordPress-native implementation"

- `includes/class-v-wpsa-report-generator.php`
  - Simplified class description to remove Yii references

---

### 3. ✅ Cache Directory Documentation

**Issue**: Why is a `wp-content/uploads/seo-audit/cache` directory created?

**Resolution**: Added clear documentation in `includes/class-v-wpsa-report-generator.php`:

```php
// Define K_PATH_CACHE for TCPDF if not already defined.
// TCPDF requires a writable cache directory for image and font processing.
// We store it in WordPress uploads directory under seo-audit/cache/.
```

**Explanation**: The TCPDF library (used for PDF generation) requires a cache directory for processing images and fonts. This is a standard requirement for PDF generation and the WordPress uploads directory is the appropriate location for such temporary files.

---

### 4. ✅ HTTPS for Analysis Checks

**Issue**: Analysis should run checks over HTTPS.

**Resolution**: The code already implements HTTPS-first behavior with HTTP fallback. Improved comments in `includes/class-v-wpsa-db.php`:

```php
// Try HTTPS first (preferred for security and modern websites).
$url      = 'https://' . $domain;
$response = wp_remote_get( $url, $request_args );

// If HTTPS fails, fall back to HTTP for older websites.
if ( is_wp_error( $response ) ) {
    $url      = 'http://' . $domain;
    $response = wp_remote_get( $url, $request_args );
}
```

**Explanation**: The plugin already prioritizes HTTPS but maintains HTTP fallback for older websites that don't support HTTPS. This is the correct implementation for maximum compatibility.

---

### 5. ✅ Template Footer Display

**Issue**: `'template.footer' => '<p>Developed by <strong><a href="https://vontainment.com">Vontainment</a></strong></p>'` is not being displayed.

**Resolution**: Fixed the default value in `includes/class-v-wpsa-config.php`. The issue was that the default configuration had an empty string for `template.footer`, which overrode the value in `config/config.php`.

Changed from:
```php
'template.footer' => '',
```

To:
```php
'template.footer' => '<p>Developed by <strong><a href="https://vontainment.com">Vontainment</a></strong></p>',
```

The footer is displayed in `templates/layout.php` and will now show the Vontainment attribution.

---

### 6. ✅ Remove Unused Yii Global Variables

**Issue**: Why do we have global `$v_wpsa_app` variable in the main plugin file when we're not using Yii anymore?

**Resolution**: Removed the following lines from `v-wp-seo-audit.php`:
```php
// Global variable to store Yii application instance.
global $v_wpsa_app;
$v_wpsa_app = null;

// NOTE: Yii initialization is NO LONGER done on page load.
// Yii is only initialized when needed by AJAX handlers (generate_report, download_pdf).
// This prevents Yii from running on common page requests, improving performance and avoiding conflicts.
```

These variables and comments are no longer needed as the plugin is fully WordPress-native.

---

### 7. ✅ Remove Forced Timezone Setting

**Issue**: We should not force timezone in a WordPress plugin.

**Resolution**: Removed the following code from `v-wp-seo-audit.php`:
```php
// phpcs:ignore WordPress.PHP.NoSilencedErrors.Discouraged
if ( ! @ini_get( 'date.timezone' ) ) {
    // phpcs:ignore WordPress.DateTime.RestrictedFunctions.timezone_change_date_default_timezone_set
    date_default_timezone_set( 'UTC' );
}
```

**Explanation**: WordPress has its own timezone management through the Settings > General admin page. Plugins should not override this setting. WordPress handles timezone conversions automatically using `current_time()` and related functions.

---

### 8. ✅ W3C Validity Table Display

**Issue**: W3C Validity should show a table of errors and warnings.

**Resolution**: 
1. Verified that `templates/report.php` already contains a table structure for W3C validation results with columns: Type, Line, and Message.
2. Fixed data decoding issue by adding 'messages' to the w3c table JSON fields in `includes/class-v-wpsa-db.php`:

```php
'w3c' => array( 'messages' ),
```

**How it works**: 
- The W3C validation messages are stored as JSON in the database
- The decoder now properly converts them to an array
- The template displays them in a responsive table with proper formatting
- Error types are shown with appropriate badge colors (danger for errors, warning for warnings)
- Messages longer than `$over_max` can be expanded/collapsed

---

### 9. ✅ Images Table Display

**Issue**: Images should show a table of images without alt text.

**Resolution**: 
1. Verified that `templates/report.php` already contains a table structure for images missing alt text.
2. Fixed data decoding issue by adding 'images_missing_alt' to the content table JSON fields in `includes/class-v-wpsa-db.php`:

```php
'content' => array( 'headings', 'deprecated', 'images_missing_alt' ),
```

**How it works**: 
- Images without alt text are identified during analysis
- They are stored as JSON in the database
- The decoder now properly converts them to an array
- The template displays them in a responsive table showing the image filename
- Full image URLs are available in the title attribute (tooltip on hover)
- Long lists can be expanded/collapsed using the expand/collapse buttons
